# MealMaestro

TODO:
- Fix CSS of the pages
- User profile page -> hooking preferences up to the backend when asking for recipes
- Making recipe cards
- NavBar + search?
- Maybe use SSR to render recipes? Takes a loooong time for it to send to frontend as a response
- After user clicks Get Recipe, should add a spinning loading logo as it takes a while and can be confusing to user.
- Handle multiple files
